# SERAA Benchmark Suite

The SERAA Generalization Benchmark evaluates the system's ability to provide nuanced, explainable, and context-sensitive ethical reasoning—even in scenarios that do not fit existing legal or regulatory patterns.

## What’s Included

- **Edge-case, conflict, meta-ethical, and ambiguous scenarios**
- **Automated and semi-automated code for running and scoring every case**
- **Human-in-the-loop rubric scoring for expert/committee reflection**
- **Full transparency, results passing high-threshold justification across all domains**

**Instructions:**
1. Run `python run_benchmark.py`
2. Score cases with `python score_benchmark.py`
3. Analyze and plot results with `python analyze_benchmark.py`
4. All cases and code are fully open for community extension and peer review.

**See results and system behavior in [benchmark_results.json] and included plots.**
